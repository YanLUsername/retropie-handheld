Inspired by my favorite childhood game on the Gameboy, Battle City, I wanted to create my own handheld gaming console to handle retro games. While there are already prebuilt options online, I wanted to customize one to fit my specifications. The project is still very new, and I am figuring things out as I go.

### Desired Features
- 3.5in Display (minimum)
- Rechargable battery
- Physical buttons
- Headphone jack
- RetroPie OS
